# Bugout.dev: Docs

Welcome to the Bugout.dev documentation repository!

Bugout provides you with knowledge bases that can automatically extract knowledge from wherever you
generate it - be it Slack, GitHub, your IDE, or your command line.

Here, you will find:
1. [Tutorials](#tutorials) about how to set up Bugout in your IDEs and at your terminal so that you can add notes and knowledge without ever breaking your flow
2. [Guides](#guides) to integrating Bugout with your Slack workspaces, GitHub organizations, and other places you generate knowledge
3. [Recipes](#recipes) for how to use Bugout to help with common programming tasks
4. [References](#references) for writing your own knowledge extractors using the Bugout API

Most of what we are building is free software. Wherever possible, we will link you to our code
repositories. We welcome issues, suggestions, and comments in general!
