# Bugout.dev: Docs

Welcome to the Bugout.dev documentation repository!

Bugout provides you with knowledge bases that can automatically extract knowledge from wherever you
generate it - be it Slack, GitHub, your IDE, or your command line.

Here, you will find:
1. [Tutorials about how to set up Bugout in your IDEs and at your terminal so that you can add notes and knowledge without ever breaking your flow](#tutorials)
2. [Guides to integrating Bugout with your Slack workspaces, GitHub organizations, and other places you generate knowledge](#integration-guides)
3. [Recipes for how to use Bugout to help with common programming tasks](#recipes)
4. [Guides to writing your own knowledge extractors using the Bugout API](#the-bugout-api)

This documentation largely assumes that you have already registered your Bugout.dev account.

If you haven't done so already, you can sign up for free at https://bugout.dev. Click on the
"Sign up for free" button on the top right.

Bugout is free for individuals and for teams with up to 5 members. For larger teams, Bugout costs
$10 per member per month.

Most of what we are building is free software. Wherever possible, we will link you to our code
repositories. We welcome issues, suggestions, and comments in general!
