# Bugout.dev: Docs

Welcome to the Bugout.dev documentation repository!

Bugout provides you with knowledge bases that can automatically extract knowledge from wherever you
generate it - be it Slack, GitHub, your IDE, or your command line.

Here, you will find:
1. Guides to installing Bugout in your Slack workspaces, GitHub organizations, and other places you
generate knowledge.
2. Tutorials about how to set up Bugout in your IDEs and at your terminal so that you can add notes
and knowledge without ever breaking your flow.
3. Recipes for how to use Bugout to help with common programming tasks.
4. Guides to writing your own knowledge extractors using the Bugout API.

This documentation largely assumes that you have already registered for your Bugout.dev account. If
you haven't done so already, you can sign up for free at https://bugout.dev.

Bugout is free for individuals and for teams with up to 5 members. For teams with 6 members or
more, Bugout costs $10 per member per month.
